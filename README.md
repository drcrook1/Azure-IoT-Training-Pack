# Azure IoT Training Pack
Description of everything.  Link to the video play list, how it all works etc.

Each section 01, 02, 03 picks up EXACTLY where the previous section leaves off.  Notice in each folder is a START and a FINISH for the module.

The start is essentially an exact copy of the previous modules FINISH.  This allows folks to build up the START to the finish without affecting the previous module.

The last module, complete-project is the fully 100% e2e completed sample solution including the upgrades from operations shipped.
